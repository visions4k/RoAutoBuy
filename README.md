# RoAutoBuy
A discord bot I created, was intentionally for multiple servers, but I no longer work on this project. This is to automate roblox purchases via clothing items.

This is extreme simular to my automated purchase bot, except this one is a little more updated, aswell it supposed mutliple servers.

Everything you have to change is config. Make sure you create a new folder with your guild ID as the folder name. I left a example of HushyGenerator configuration, so you can get a idea of what the config will look like.
Most of the details about the bot is in my other github repo "automated-purchase" - this is just a more updated version that provides support for multiple servers, and a bit easier to configure. This one does not provide slash commands, hence you cannot register different "options" (slash command options) to different servers.
